# Dog and Cat Classifier using CNN

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a Dog and Cat Classifier built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to distinguish between images of dogs and cats using deep learning techniques. The classifier takes an image as input and predicts whether it contains a dog or a cat.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python

- TensorFlow/Keras

- OpenCV (for image processing)

- NumPy & Pandas

- Matplotlib (for visualization)

- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used for training consists of labeled images of dogs and cats. It is sourced from publicly available datasets like Kaggle’s Dogs vs. Cats Dataset.
